I have created a .NET Framework 4.8 ASP.NET Web Application project. To set up the database for this project, follow these steps:

Restore the Database: Use the attached .bak or .sql file to restore the database named "LIBRARY_DB".

Include the Connection String: Make sure to include the connection string for LIBRARY_DB in the web.config file.
